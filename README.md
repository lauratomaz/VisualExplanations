# VisualExplanations

This repository contains the code for our data augmentation, deep learning models and visual explanations.

1. Code for the data augmentation we used in our dataset can be found in:
Data Augmentation.ipynb

2. Code for our deep learning models, except for our Genetic Algorithms, can be found in:
Deep Learning models.ipynb

3. Lastly, the visual explanations techniques we used are in:
Visual Explanations.ipynb

P.S.: If you would like to see how GradCAM worked for each of our groups of subjects (dyslexics vs. typical readers), you can find Nifti files in our Nifti directory containing the average visualization for each group. Once you download such visualization, open AFNI on your local machine and have fun seeing the brain regions who were most important to our classification between groups.
